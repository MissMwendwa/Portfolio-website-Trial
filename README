#One-page website using vanilla Javascript.
I have decided to create this website to remind myself some front-end programming skills.
The labguages involved are HTML,CSS & Javascript.
This is strictly for practise purposed and to learn some javascript basics.
Practise as much as you want and as often as you can to become better.
#until next project, Happy Coding!
